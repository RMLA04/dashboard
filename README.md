## ✨ Features

- 🎮 **Interactive visualizers** for every topic — watch algorithms run step by step
- 🌙 / ☀️ **Dark & Light theme** toggle
- ❓ **"How to use" guide** built into every section
- ⚡ **Adjustable animation speed** (Sorting visualizer)
- 🎨 Ripple click effects, animated nodes and bars, color-coded complexity pills
- 📖 Theory panel + Big-O complexity table for each topic
- 💻 Fully **offline** — no internet, no libraries, no dependencies

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1 — Open locally
1. Download `index.html`
2. Double-click it — opens directly in any browser

1. Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. Drag and drop `index.html`
3. Get a shareable live URL instantly

### Option 3 — Deploy via GitHub + Vercel
1. Push `index.html` to a GitHub repository
2. Import the repo on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Add a `vercel.json` with `{ "outputDirectory": "public" }` if needed

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```
dsa-dashboard/
└── index.html       # Entire app — HTML + CSS + JS in one file
└── README.md        # This file
```

## 🧠 How the Dashboard Works

Each topic section contains three panels:

1. **Theory** — Background explanation of the concept
2. **Complexity Table** — Best, Average, Worst case Big-O
3. **Interactive Visualizer** — Animate and interact with the algorithm or data structure in real time

## 🛠️ Built With

- Pure **HTML5**
- Pure **CSS3** (CSS variables for theming, animations, transitions)
- Pure **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks, no libraries)
